  The website is developed with two aims;
  > To enable me gain better knowledge of Microsoft Azure, and,
  > To give me an online presence.

  The website has minimal media functionality and almost no user interaction.
  Anonymous users can communicate with the site owner by sending a direct message or via email.

  I neither have the resources to deal with usernames and passwords nor am I willing to deal with it. As such, users cannot signup with the site.
