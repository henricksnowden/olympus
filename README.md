  The website is developed with two aims;
  > To enable me gain better knowledge of Microsoft Azure, and,
  > To give me an online presence since I do not use social media sites.

  The website has minimal media functionality and almost no user interaction.
  Anonymous users can communicate with the site owner by sending me a direct message or via email.
  They may also choose to take a look at my publicly available projects on Github.

  Those seeking to advertise on the site may send a direct message through the website, or, alternatively,
  they may choose to send an email if they think themselves too formal.

  I neither have the resources to deal with usernames and passwords nor am I willing to deal with it. As such, users cannot signup with the site.
